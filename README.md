We propose 
**TRIM** 
(**T**rajectory 
**R**eduction and 
**I**nstance 
**M**ask denoising), a post-training approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial trimming strategies, to accelerate inference without compromising output quality while supporting the inference-time scaling for 3D Gaussian diffusion models.


The source code will be released soon.
